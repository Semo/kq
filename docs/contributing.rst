Contributing
------------

Instructions
============

Before submitting a pull request on GitHub_, please make sure you meet the
**requirements**:

* The pull request points to the dev_ (development) branch.
* All changes are squashed into a single commit (I like to use git rebase -i
  to do this).
* The commit message is in present tense (good: "Add feature", bad:
  "Added feature").
* Correct and consistent style: Sphinx_-compatible docstrings, using snake
  vs. camel casing properly_ and PEP8_ compliance. Use flake8_ (see below).
* No classes/methods/functions with missing docstrings or commented-out lines.
  You can refer to existing docstrings for examples.
* The test coverage_ remains at %100. Sometimes you may find yourself having to
  write superfluous unit tests to keep this number up. If a piece of code is
  trivial and has no need for unittests, use this_ to exclude it from coverage.
* No build failures on TravisCI_. The builds automatically trigger on PR
  submissions.
* Does not break backward-compatibility (unless there is a really good reason).
* Compatibility with all supported Python versions (2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6).

.. warning::
    The dev branch is occasionally rebased_, and its commit history may be
    overwritten in the process (I try very hard never to do this). So before
    you begin feature work, git fetch/pull to ensure that branches have not
    diverged. If you see git conflicts and just want to start from scratch,
    run this command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ~$ git checkout dev
        ~$ git fetch origin
        ~$ git reset --hard origin/dev  # THIS WILL WIPE ALL CHANGES

Style
=====

To ensure PEP8_ compliance, run flake8_:

.. code-block:: bash

    ~$ pip install flake8
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/joowani/kq.git
    ~$ cd kq
    ~$ flake8

You should try to resolve all issues reported. If there is a good reason to
ignore errors from a specific piece of code, however, visit here_ to see how
to exclude the lines from the check.

Testing
=======

To test your changes, run the unit tests that come with **kq** on your
local machine. The tests use pytest_.

To run the unit tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    ~$ pip install pytest
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/joowani/kq.git
    ~$ cd kq
    ~$ py.test --verbose

To run the unit tests with coverage report:

.. code-block:: bash

    ~$ pip install coverage pytest pytest-cov
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/joowani/kq.git
    ~$ cd kq
    ~$ py.test --verbose --cov-report=html --cov=kq
    ~$ # Open the generated file htmlcov/index.html in a browser


Documentation
=============

The documentation (including the README) is written in reStructuredText_ and
uses Sphinx_. To build the HTML version of the documentation on your local
machine:

.. code-block:: bash

    ~$ pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/joowani/kq.git
    ~$ cd kq/docs
    ~$ sphinx-build . build
    ~$ # Open the generated file build/index.html in a browser


As always, thanks for your contribution!
